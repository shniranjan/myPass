This script helps to generate password and store into memory for 10 seconds and clears itself which can be used as password.

Since generated code only stays into memory for 10 seconds, the code used to generate salted-password can be saved in less secure environment as long as the master salt-password is secure.

The password generated by the script are harder to crack using bruitforce attack.
